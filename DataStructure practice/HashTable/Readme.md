# Background
##    At my third term to work as a CS Teaching Assistant, My teacher didn't create email lists to communicate students,instead,he gave us the roster with students'names and emails. In order to get the email list, I created the Hash table in C++ to store all students'infomation and output their emails to the email.txt
